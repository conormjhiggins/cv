intro,"Analytics Engineer with five years building and owning data pipelines at Deliveroo and DAZN, from raw ingestion through to dimensional models and the dashboards that commercial and science teams rely on daily. A lot of that time has gone into making existing systems faster, cheaper and easier to maintain, and more recently into helping teams make proper use of AI tooling. Outside of work, sport and data rarely stay separate: my Masters dissertation was a Bayesian model of Premier League football outcomes."
