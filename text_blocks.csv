intro,"I am a Senior Analytics Engineer with five years building and owning data pipelines at Deliveroo, from raw ingestion through to dimensional models and the dashboards that commercial and science teams rely on daily. I take pride in finding smarter, more efficient ways of working, whether that's driving meaningful cost savings through thoughtful refactoring and performance optimisation, or helping engineering teams embrace AI tooling to improve how we build. I'm especially motivated by the intersection of sport and data, which I explored in my Master's dissertation on Bayesian modelling of Premier League football outcomes."
